# VideoLAN docker images

VideoLAN docker images are used in [Jenkins] jobs to provide static build environments.

On push, the [Docker Images Job] will launch and figure out the images that need to be rebuilt.

The results will be available on VideoLAN docker registry under registry.videolan.org:5000/$tag.

If you require a new Linux distro to be a base of your future image(-s), please put it under videolan-base/ directory.
